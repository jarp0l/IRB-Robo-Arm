# IRB-Robo-Arm
*aka Image Recognition Based Robotic Arm

This repo contains the arduino and AI(machine learning) codes that we used in our above mentioned project for LOCUS 2020.
It was a thematic project under UN's SDG #3 - Good Health and Well-Being. 



Members of the project were:
1. Aakansha Giri (076BEI004)
2. Anju Chhetri (076BEI005)
3. Devraj Parajuli (076BEI013)
4. Dikshya Parajuli (076BEI041)
5. Prajwol Pradhan (076BEI023)
6. Sumit Yadav (076BCT088)

The project had three different aspects, according to which the team was divided: 

  -> Hardware aspect         | 3D printed hand, support for the hand (arm)
  
  -> Arduino aspect          | Code for controlling the actuation of motors, based on the data sent by the ML algorithm
  
  -> Machine Learning aspect | Code for detecting what it was trained for, based on the datasets taken during the training.
